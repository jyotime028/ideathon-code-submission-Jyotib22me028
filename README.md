  We have designed a library management system using linked list and hashtable  .To execute  the code, both files i.e library management.c and books.csv should be in same folder.
  Our system is mainly divided into two parts one is librarian persective and other is student perspective . For a librarian to use the sytem he should first enter valid credentials then he will be able to do tasks 
 such as adding books, removing books etc  from library and for a student to use the system he should first sign up and sign in to issue a book .
